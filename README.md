# RegressionOptimization
Principles of Operation Research (IE 5318) project. Turning Regression into an Optimization.

To do

################### Plug in Gurobi intercept and coefficient into a regression, measure residuals, and compare to normal regression.

################### Testing table- The table Dr.V gave us: setup several tests, repeat them between methods, compare results.

################### replace data with lab- use data from the lab instead of whole number from BFI dataset.

################### Print and compare residuals- setup a mechanism to print residuals for each method.

################### Setup Excel- create large Excel sheet which can accomodate every step of a regression for large datasets
